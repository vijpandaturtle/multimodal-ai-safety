"""Logit lens for the LM half of a VLM.

The cheapest first look at what an intermediate state "means": pretend the model stopped there and
decode it. For VLMs it's especially useful at *image-token* positions, which have no next-token
target, so it's the only direct way to ask "does this patch's representation look like the word
'car' yet?" It's biased toward late layers (early states aren't in the unembedding's basis);
tuned lenses fix that, and are a later addition if the plain lens turns out too noisy.
